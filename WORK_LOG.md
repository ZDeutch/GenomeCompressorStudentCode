I know that I need to map the four letters, A,C,G,T to  binary numbers 00,01,10,11. I need to use the BinaryStdIn and BinaryStdOut to read and write the data from the file. I feel as though in theory it should be faster make the file exactly 30% of its original size rather than any less. I still have to figure out exactly how to take the data from the file and compress it using a map. |
| November 17 | 7:00 - 8:15 pm | I spent the majority of this time reading over the files and understanding what BinaryStandrdIn and Out were. Once I understood they write the code in binary based on the chars, it became relatively easy to implement. For the compress method you read in the genome sequence, then for each char simply see which letter in dna it is and give it a 2 bit value. them read in those two bits and do it for the entire sequence. The expand works in opposite where you read in two ints at a time and find their corresponding letter before mapping to the traditional 8 bit sequence. I wonder if there is a more efficient way to do this as right now I do linear amount of comparisons. |
